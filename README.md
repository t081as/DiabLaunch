    UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: ACCESS_VIOLATION (C0000005)

It is possible to launch Diablo 2 in windowed mode with the following command:

    > Diablo II.exe -nofixaspect -w

DiabLaunch executes Diablo 2 in windowed mode, removes the window border and sets the window to full screen mode on your primary screen.
